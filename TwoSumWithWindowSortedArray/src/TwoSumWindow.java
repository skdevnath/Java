public class TwoSumWindow {
    // In Amazon interview they asked me to find two's sum, where given array is sorted.
    //    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
    //
    //    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    //            return [0, 1].
    // This can be solved with window (have right and left pointer).
